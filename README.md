In this first section :-

    In the first line We have <!DOCTYPE html>, which declares the document type.

    <html> tag, which defines the whole html document.

    Then I have used the "head" contains meta information about the HTML page such as title of the webpage(using "title" tag)
    
    <title>Table Formation</title> element sets the title of the HTML document, which appears on the browser's title bar or tab.

    Inside the body tag, a form is created using these tags :-

            <fieldset> tag is used to group related elements in a form and it draws a box around the related elements.
            <legend> tag is used to define a caption for the <fieldset> element.
            The <label> element associates a label with an input element. 
            Three <input> element with type "text" are used for entering the first name, middle name and last name, and <label> is used to give them a label.
            The <br> tag is a self-closing tag used to insert a line break (new line) within the content.

In this section of the form:-

      (<input type="radio" name="gender"/>) input tag is used with type as "radio", which lets only one option to be choosen. The "name" attribute groups them together, allowing only one option to be selected.
      An input element with type "datetime-local" for entering the date and time of birth is used.
      An input element with type "tel" is used for entering the phone number. The "maxlength" attribute limits the number of characters, and the "size" attribute sets the visible size of the input box. Before that we have also used an input element with type "text" but it also contains "value" and "diabled", which means the option will be pre-filled with the "value" specified and it will be disabled, meaning it can't be changed.
      A <textarea> element is used for entering some text which is a little longer. Here it is used for address.
      An input element with type "email" is used for entering the email address.

In this section of the form :-

       An input element with type "password" for entering the password, by using this type as password, the password won't be visible to the user or anyone else when entering the password in the form.

      An input element with type "reset" is used to create a reset button to reset the form fields.
      An input element with type "button" is used for creating a button of any kind, here I created a submit button for submitting the form data.
